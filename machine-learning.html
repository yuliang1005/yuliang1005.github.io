						<h3>What does it do?</h3>
						<p>Let's first explain what machine learning is:
						<br>It is the science of artificial intelligence. The main research object in this field is artificial intelligence, especially how to improve the performance of specific algorithms through experiential learning. It is a study of computer algorithms that can be improved automatically through experience. It is the use of data or past experience to optimize the performance of computer programs.
						<br>Machine learning’s purpose is to make decisions with minimal human intervention.
						<br>The following are some of the latest research on machine learning, which are very likely to be implemented in recent years.</p>
						
						<h3>Transfer learning for vision-based tactile sensing</h3>
						<p>The ability of machines to simulate human senses is not the same. In the five senses of humans (visual, auditory, olfactory, taste, touch), the development of computer-simulated touch is probably the slowest.
						<br>For this purpose, researchers Raffaello D’Andrea and Carmelo Sferrazza published a paper entitled <<Transfer Learning for Vision-Based Tactile Sensing>>.
						<br>The paper advocates the use of "soft optical (or vision-based) tactile sensors", which is low-cost, easy to manufacture and has less wiring. The model trains and helps tactile sensors for object recognition through the visual function of the computer. Their proprietary system uses a soft-gel sensor and a computer vision training network in which the deformation of the elastic material as it is subjected to force can be perceived by the camera on the soft surface. Force distribution.
</p>

						<h3>Self-Supervised Learning of Face Representations for Video Face Clustering</h3>
						<p>In recent years, with the development of technology, scientists have begun to rethink the application range of face recognition technology and other application methods.
						<br>As far as systems for video research are concerned, research has shifted from the initial identification of the main characters to the use of facial knowledge to analyze stories.
						<br>A paper by the University of Toronto called "Self-Supervised Learning of Face Representations for Video Face Clustering" points out that based on the storyline, a deeper understanding of the video can predict which characters will appear where and when. To this end, they developed an unsupervised model that was able to create highly accurate facial recognition models based on existing databases and training.
						<br>The model does not have to rely solely on the currently used track information, but can dynamically generate positive/negative constraints based on ordered face distances. There is great potential for video analysis for the future.
						</p>
						
						<h3>Competitive Training of Mixtures of Independent Deep Generative Models</h3>
						<p>The Variable Automatic Encoder (VAE) and the Generated Confrontation Network (GAN) are the most prominent types of models for unsupervised learning, but each has significant drawbacks: VAE is difficult to generate high quality samples when feeding natural images. GAN requires a lot of training. A recent research project by a research team at the Max Planck Institute aims to improve the shortcomings of each model by taking advantage of both, using a method to train multiple models in parallel, focusing on distribution. The independent part of the training. In the paper "Mixed Competitive Training for Independent Depth Generation Models", summarizing their findings, using models more intuitively, or using multiple types at the same time, will create a more powerful environment for model training, allowing for more extensive use of data. There are some implications for how to make model selections on the fly.
</p>
						<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
						<p>In the past decades, people's life has gradually become inseparable from the computer, it can be said that the computer has affected all aspects of people. Now, the rise of machine learning has led to a dramatic increase in the degree and speed of automation. Machine learning is a revolutionary technology that has brought great productivity. However, there is little consensus on the potential of machine learning in the application field. The only consensus is that machine learning will have a huge impact on productivity and economy.
						<br>Because some jobs are suitable to be done by machine learning system instead, and some jobs are not suitable to be done by machine learning instead, and the impact of machine learning on economy is still limited at present. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the employment problems caused by the development of machine learning. 
						<br>It is impossible for machines to completely replace human beings. In terms of value, although machines can perform some tasks in place of humans(such as heavy lifting, assembly and disassembly. But it also makes jobs that cannot be replaced by machines more valuable. As the machine learning system approaches the human capabilities of certain positions, positions that complement these systems will emerge. And when machine learning systems are more cost-effective than humans, entrepreneurs or businessmen naturally use machines to replace humans in order to maximize profits. In turn, this will increase productivity, lower prices, shift labour demand, and restructure the industry.
						<br>Machine learning algorithms have brought two influences to the field of programming. First: is that by training neural networks, more accurate algorithms can be obtained than those programmed by programmers (such as facial recognition). Second: this model greatly reduces the cost of creating and maintaining new software.

						<h3> How will this affect you?</h3>
						<p>As technology advances, machine learning has been applied to daily life. Some shopping websites including subscription services use machine learning technology to predict my preferences and recommend products to me, so that I can save a lot of time for all items.My family likes taking photos with mobile phones, but the technology of taking photos is not very good. The appearance of face recognition makes it easier for my family to take photos they want.
						<br>At the same time, the emergence of some home robots (such as smart cleaning robots) has greatly improved the quality of our lives as machine learning can improve the automation of mechanical products. Only cleaning robots can help us clean the ground quickly, so that we have more time to do other things.
						<br>Machine learning can even change the way people learn. My family has read many paper books when looking for materials, which is very inefficient. But now they only need to enter the key in the search engine, there will be a lot of relevant content on the webpage, which greatly improves the learning efficiency. This technique is especially useful when you want to filter out messages you want to see from messages you don't want to see. The spam discovery system uses sample mail to filter spam and identify spam by looking for specific words, specific sender names, or other characteristics. This ability can be said to directly avoid a lot of spam into my sight.
						<br>It’s especially interesting to have a virtual personal assistant on your phone, such as Siri. Because they can be recognized by voice, I can use the verbal command to ask the phone to perform tasks such as calling, searching, etc., very convenient. And they can also imitate different human voices, such as: male voice, female voice, little girl's voice, and so on.</p>
