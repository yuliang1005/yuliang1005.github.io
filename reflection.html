					<p>The extracurricular meeting time for our group is: September 7, September 8, September 14, September 15, and September 22. Members of each group complete their own parts on time and actively communicate with other members, making our team more united and finish our work wonderfully.
</p>
<p>All in all, everything went well in our team ATM. There is nothing more we can improve for teamwork, if there is, must be our English standard. What really surprised me was that our team completed the main body of the assignment almost a week before submission. I learned the more detailed plans in this group collaboration, and the easier it is to complete the overall project efficiently. The spirit of helping each other in the team also enabled me to learn that complementary skills can create better results. The foundation of teamwork is to respect individual interests and achievements. The core is synergy. The realm is the centripetal force and cohesiveness of all members, reflecting the unity of individual interests and overall interests, and thus ensuring the efficient operation of the organization. Swinging personality and performance expertise ensure that members accomplish their mission goals together, and a clear sense of collaboration and collaboration creates teamwork. This helps to stimulate the motivation of team members and helps to increase the overall potential of the team. These psychological factors unwittingly enhance the ambition of the members, so that members do not consciously ask themselves to make progress.
</p>
<p>This group activity is very meaningful for me because it teaches me some experience. First of all, the subtotal of the team must be assigned to each member in advance so that they can work with a clear goal. Everyone in our group has more equal tasks and everyone is very active in cooperation. Communication between team members is something we need to improve. All of our text messages are Shared with each other, so I hope we can make some Suggestions on the work of other team members.This can help others find some possible problems and modify them to improve their quality. To my surprise, there were some students in the group who were good at making web pages, because I didn't have any knowledge of HTML as a freshman. We can consult him if we don't understand in this respect. In addition, I learned to understand others from this teamwork.Some of us need to organize our work and merge it into the final version, so I think everyone should improve their efficiency to support him. I think the net shows our final result very well. It includes all the relevant text information and pictures for each part of the assignment. Its distribution is clearer and easier to navigate than reports.</p>
