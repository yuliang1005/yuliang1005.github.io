            <p>Cybersecurity goes important now because it is a  technology which can produce computers, networks and programs. The more computer users, the more demand for cyber security. Technology is essential to giving organizations and individuals the computer security tools needed to protect themselves from cyber attacks. 
</p>
            <p>One of the new technology is called unified threat management system which can automate integrations select Security products and accelerate key security operations functions such as : detection, investigation, and remediation. All organizations must have a framework for how they deal with both attempted and successful cyber attacks. Endpoint devices like computers, smart devices, and routers are the most important things need to be product. </p>
            <p>Major areas covered in cyber security are:
            <br>application security, information security, disaster security and network security. In order to solve these problems, you need to be proficient in these technologies: physical security and operational security technologies, data security and content security technologies, and information defense technologies. Many researches on information security products of network companies have become more and more in-depth, such as: firewall products, intrusion detection and intrusion prevention products, unified threat management products, encryption products, identity management products, electronic signature products and terminal security management products.Various types of services have also become more common, such as: compliance consulting, security integration, risk assessment, security inspection, penetration testing, emergency protection, all of which are professional information security services. The existing information security and application delivery devices in the industry usually have weak networking capabilities and need to be deployed together with network devices. The demand for multi-functional and converged security products is growing, and related products will accelerate development. The rapid development of various Internet applications, especially video, games and mobile Internet, the rapid growth of network traffic, the rapid increase in user demand for network security products, and the rapid growth in demand for high-end products. Security issues have arisen on the part of individual users, and information disclosure incidents have intensified. For example, the sports product company Under Armour's MyFitnessPal health tracking account has been attacked, resulting in the theft of private data of about 150 million people. Now that we have opened various recruitment websites, we can see that the demand for various security talents is strong, which is a scene that has not been presented in previous years. Countries all over the world are investing heavily in human resources in the field of information security. For example, Israel is currently implementing a key talent training program. Information technology has gradually become a basic social symbol. A large number of devices can be networked, including the popularization of mobile devices such as mobile phones and the development of the Internet of Things. As a result, information technology has social attributes, which makes the extension of network security expand from a narrow The computer category has expanded to the entire social, national, and global context.
<br>In the next few years, security will become one of the four infrastructures in the cloud computing field along with computing, storage and networking. The rapid development of cloud computing has brought huge market space and commercial value to the network security industry. The information security industry has spawned a new type of application delivery. Currently, there is strong demand in this field, and there is a large market space and commercial value.

            <p>Ransomware is often found on users' computers in 2018. Its principle is to lock all files on the user's system, making the computer not working properly. When important files are stored in the computer, the user's choice can only be to pay the ransom to the hacker. Even so, no one can guarantee the safe return of his documents. Malware is software designed to gain unauthorized access or damage to your computer. Phishing is the most common form of cyber attack. Generally, it uses email or phishing websites. The ultimate goal is to swindle users' trust and get their sensitive information such as credit card numbers or account login information. The biggest impact is that as the cyber threat situation continues to grow and many emerging threats that never emerge require hardware and software skills, more computer practitioners will be needed, and it is estimated that there are 1 million unfilled cybersecurity efforts around the world. IT professionals and other computer experts are needed in security work, these practitioners will have more:
</p>
            <p>Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): This person implements a security program throughout the organization and oversees the operations of the IT security department.
Security Engineer: This person focuses on quality control within the IT infrastructure to protect company assets from threats.
</p>
            <p>Security Architect: This person is responsible for planning, analyzing, designing, testing, maintaining and supporting the critical infrastructure of the enterprise.
</p>
            <p>Security Analyst: This person has multiple responsibilities, including planning security measures and controls, protecting digital files, and conducting internal and external security audits. The increase in demand for these jobs will have many positive effects. The most important point is that network companies will recruit experienced programmers who are good at network attack and defense. This group of people will include hackers who have previously made computer exploits, thus greatly reducing the number of computers that will be attacked thereafter. Not only can the company's firewall strength be increased, but it also reduces the probability of an ordinary user's computer being compromised.
 
</p>
            <p>The impact on me is mainly to indicate the direction of the future development of cyber security technology, and as a student who is learning computer programming, I will know which part will become the research of Internet companies in the future. In my daily life, my computer will become more secure, because fewer and fewer spoofed attackers will be created, and the bundled software will be reduced. Every user benefits from advanced cyber defence programs nowadays. Any cybersecurity attack can occur from identity theft to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like password or personal photos.  Securing big organizations and other offices are essential to keeping our society functioning. Different types of cyber attacks can cause different degrees of damage to the computer. A more specific type of cybersecurity threat is called social engineering. It is a strategy scammer that uses various methods to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Some people can use this method to request currency payments or access to your confidential data. It's worth noting that social engineering can be used in conjunction with every threat listed above, making it more likely that users will click on the links, download malware or trust malicious sources. For my friends and family, they only need basic computer knowledge and anti-fraud awareness, correctly identify phishing emails and find phishing websites with the help of anti-virus software. There is no need to worry too much when surfing the Internet. Whether you are browsing the web or watching videos, there will be more protection for the computer.
