											<p>Now, people no longer need to store all their documents on a particular device. As cloud computing technology develops and matures, they could access their files from any terminal at any time. The cloud has always represented the Internet because cloud symbols are often used to describe the Internet in diagrams. Both of them share information through satellite networks. Cloud computing itself means sharing information resources through network platforms. These information are stored on a physical server in the cloud and it provides maintenance and control services. Apple's iCloud is a common example. There is a look at the scope of cloud computing services. Any user who uses it could access the information stored in the cloud over the Internet. Cloud storage could assist users access this information from anywhere and provide a download service to any device such as a laptop, tablet or smartphone. Moreover, editing and modifying these files supports simultaneous operations by multiple users. For example, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, or statistical tables that people use a lot at work could be made easier to use. In addition, there are many other types of cloud computing services that may meet more usage needs. Some services store photos and videos of individual users, while others services are for IT application development companies which need adequate platform. A server is a computer that processes requests and sends information to another computer over the Internet or a local network. There are several types of servers including local servers and file servers that store data in the Intranet. In fact, any computer that supports the necessary software to run can act as a server, but it's more about the big, high-performance machines. Most computer networks support one or more servers to handle specific tasks. The larger the network, the more likely it is that multiple servers will play a role. Each server has a specific purpose because it is software that could handle specific tasks. Many networks on the Internet use the client-server network model to integrate web sites and communication services. Another model, called peer-to-peer networking, allows all devices on the network to act as servers or clients on demand. Peer-to-peer networks provide users with greater privacy protection because communication between computers is targeted. A web server farm is a collection of web servers and each server on the network could share information on the same site. Servers could be understood as a software so people could use them at home. This gives them access to devices connected to the home network and to devices outside the network. The Web server displays the page in the Web browser and runs the application. The server to which people normally connect to their browsers is actually a web server. It is usually passing a page and any images associated with it. For instance, common client hosts include Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Safari. The Web server is also used to upload and back up files online through cloud storage services or online backup services. Besides, the email server brings people greater efficiency in sending and receiving email messages. If a user has an email client on his computer, the associated software connects to the IMAP or POP server and downloads the user's messages to the computer and connects to the SMTP server. He could then send messages through an email server. The FTP server supports moving files through file transfer tools. It can also be accessed remotely through an FTP client program. All programs can be directly connected to the server through the server's built-in FTP function or dedicated FTP server program to achieve file sharing. The identity server is a separate role that supports login and security for authorized users.

											<p>The advent of cloud computing has increased file mobility. This is because people could access documents from any device anywhere in the world. For some companies, the technology could help their employees work from home and travel without having to take any documents with them. Cloud computing also indirectly improves productivity because it allows workers to exchange information more quickly. They could work on the same document without having to work in the same place as a team. Storage space has also improved significantly. In the past, memory was limited by certain devices, people needed a new USB drive to backup the information of the current device to solve the problem of insufficient memory. Cloud computing gives users more storage so they don't have to worry about running out of hard disk space. Otherwise, It's easy to set up and work for most people. People could set up a cloud computing service and adjust their personal Settings in minutes. Furthermore, people could also immediately start using relevant resources, software, or information. The cloud vendor's automatic update service to ensures that all updates are available. This effectively saves the users time. In addition, people do not need any relevant knowledge to update their devices because cloud computing providers will automatically notify users and some updated tips. On the other hand, cloud computing also reduces the cost of users because it is usually very cheap and even many applications are free. Users could assign computing resources to any type of work according to different requirements. This eliminates the traditional need for IT administrators to provide and manage computing resources. Companies could change as their computing needs change. This eliminates the need for large-scale investment in local infrastructure. Cloud service providers typically implement redundant resources to ensure resilient storage and keep important workloads of users running. Organizations could move certain workloads to or from the cloud to different cloud platforms, either as appropriate or automatically.

											<p>As a student, cloud computing came into my daily life very early on. In the process of learning, teachers began to use documents and slides instead of books to expand the scope of students' knowledge. This class information can be viewed by students at any time and on any device. For example, sometimes I have problems in finishing my homework or reviewing. These former teaching documents may help me find important information and even relative methods. Google documentation also makes my personal learning more convenient. Teachers no longer need to send fixed documents by mail to inform students. They only needs to set up the sharing in the corresponding online document to achieve the transmission effect. What's more, I could modify the information and show it to others at the same time. This feature makes some team work or assignments easier to implement. We don't have to choose a separate places for discussion and work. Team members might create and share files in any format and work with others to complete different parts. The service of adding comments replaces the discussion in real life. Actually, I use and enjoy these services without paying any fees. Moreover, Search engines are the most common way I use to get information. The text and pictures on the page came from the server and it provided almost all the information I needed. It's also very simple to use and it's often used to search for relevant information by identifying keywords. The email server provides me with a service to send and receive messages between others. Some notifications of my bank account, cell phone account, and school are received by email. The identity server guarantees security every time I log in. Servers and cloud computing are vast and evolving, but I've only touched on the basics. My classmates and friends have the same experience as me because these technologies really simplify people's study and life.
