								This is the second team task of our group, so part of the work is easier to carry out. Our division of labor is much clearer than it was last time because everyone is in class together analyzing the assignment requirements. We found that there was less variety this time than last time, but the description of the group's ideal project needed more detail. For this reason, we decided to assign this part to three team members. The result is that everyone's tasks are probably close to the group average.This shows that our division of labor is clear and fair. Of course, these are after all the work of the whole team, so some parts still need everyone's participation. For topics that are relatively difficult or need some new ideas, we also help each other and discuss solutions. These cooperative parts highlight the importance of communication. Every team member understands this, so we have a lot of communication both online and offline. We ask each other about their progress and check for mistakes. Individual Suggestions are put forward directly in the discussion group and the group members express their own opinions on it. We as a group should be concerned about everyone's progress and situation instead of just finishing our own part. I think we did well in the team assignment.

									As for what needs to be improved, we still need to be motivated in our work. Making a game may be a long way off, but we can start by understanding its production process and expertise. In our hearts, we should maintain a learning attitude towards this kind of knowledge. Then everyone will be more conscientious and not feel like it's just part of the assignment. The purpose of finishing the homework is that students could learn something useful from it. Therefore, I hope the group members may adjust their attitude. What surprised me was how much expertise and production process VR games require. Before, I just thought it was demanding on information technology, but now I know it is the same for modeling and design. I learned that everyone should have a sense of responsibility in group work. Team members need to always think about their team and think about how they can achieve better results. Finally, as for the presentation results of the web page, I found it easier to read than the text report. Its titles are like catalogs of how each of us works. It also indirectly shows the professionalism of our group work and is more conducive to spreading it to others.
