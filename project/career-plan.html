								（1）Wenjie Chen(Software Engineer): This year is the beginning of my undergraduate study in information technology, so I just started to learn programming language recently. In addition, The actual work experience is not relevant to the current industry. From my present situation, the ideal career still needs  a lot of planning and process to get there. I decided to start with the little things in studying and working. Usually in class, I will try my best to understand what the teacher says and contact relevant knowledge on my own initiative. I will also do some technical exercises according to my personal interests. This should improve my professional level in a long way. First, I will go to the library to borrow some books related to programming language and practice the examples in them. In fact, I often communicate with some experienced classmates or ask for help because many of them had a background in programming. Next, I'm studying on websites like codecademy. This includes theoretical explanations and related practice opportunities. At the same time, I also want to try my best to complete my professional tasks. All these are new to me, so I need more time to digest them. As a result, I could only explore and solve these problems by myself. After graduating from college, I want to participate in some basic work of information technology. Some common code and design will improve my ability to work. In my spare time, I will continue to learn professional knowledge to meet the requirements of my ideal career.

									（2）Jinglin(JAVA developer): Compared with the ideal job requirements, I have fewer skills now, because I just started my Bachelor of IT, and now I know a little Java and SQL. However, I do not have the relevant professional experience in IT or some other qualifications I am a newcomer. According to the present conditions, I should learn and master all the contents of the course, and try my best to improve my English level, oral expression ability and writing ability. Try to find an IT related job after graduation, so as to accumulate work experience and complete various projects. According to what I have learned in school and the skills I have mastered, I will decide whether to continue to study full-time or part-time.

									（3）Qiheng Chen(Python developer): According to the job description, I will be a developer of Python to update production-grade applications. Building comprehensive machine learning libraries is the main work. The other part is scheme data science solution for our clients. This job appealing to me because it can combine working and learning together. In the process of working, it is necessary to be flexibility and communicable. Group working is always be a basic skill need to learn even more so do my job with other Python Engineers and data scientists. The standard of this role is 3 years of experience with Python. If you are proficient in using Django and Flask, it will be given priority. For the plan of myself, I am going to pick some course about Python and SQL. I already learned some SQL language during study database but its not enough to apply this job. After 2 years learning, I will get a fieldwork for 1 year as a Python engineer. And then it will be the time for me to apply this job.

									（4）Yuliang Lei(UI / UX Designer): My ideal job is UI and UX designer. The common element with other team members is that we all need professional knowledge of information technology, and we all need experience in interacting with customers, which is the most important thing in UI and UX design and what I am currently lacking. Different from other members of the team, this requires not only professional knowledge of information technology, but also design skills, although I am confident in this aspect. Therefore, in the future, I will first learn professional information technology knowledge in the university, successfully graduate, and then accumulate experience in customer interaction through work，and achieve my ideal job.

									（5）Zixun Zhou(Software Engineer):
									<br><b>My existing skills and experience</b>
									<br>I currently only have basic IT technology, can make simple websites (HTML and php), can also use Java to make simple small programs, and also have basic database and networking knowledge. The project will also be adjusted according to the needs of the user, and the process knowledge of the project development will also be available.I have experience working on a website alone and team building app experience.
									<br><b>Plan</b>
									<br>First, I will study IT technology at school. Second, I will learn the techniques I need on various teaching websites. Third, I will study the skills I need in books. Fourth, I will work in related areas to improve my experience and knowledge during my free time. (For example, to help customers make simple websites and apps) Fifth, continue to learn, increase their academic qualifications and technology, and increase employment rate.

								According to our career plans to meet these requirements from ideal jobs. Most of our team members have similar ideas. Almost all of us want to finish our current degree first and we think that some of these courses could provide us with job-related basics. Besides, we all think it is necessary to improve our language,English. To achieve this, it is a good choice to communicate with teachers and classmates in daily life. Some team members also suggested using their spare time to engage in simple service work to enhance their writing and presentation because they are skills people need for every job. In contrast, our group members mentioned some unique learning methods, such as borrowing books in the library, searching for knowledge points on the Internet and learning online courses. Because our present ability is limited, we are not qualified for some advanced work in the short term. Before entering the ideal job, most of us hope to accumulate some basic work experience. That's part of the actual learning. We could start with simple web pages and software. This will assist us familiarize ourselves with the process and techniques of our work in advance. The information technology industry is interconnected, so getting involved in related work may increase productivity. In summary, the members of our group are all freshmen in the information technology undergraduate program. These methods may could effectively improve our ability to get close to our ideal career.
