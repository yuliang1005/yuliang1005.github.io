								1. My name is Yuliang Lei and my student number is s3704446. My email address is
								s3704446@student.rmit.edu.au. China is my hometown and I could speak Mandarin
								and Chinese. I have finished Diploma of IT. My hobbies are playing guitar and
								gaming. I love using mobile phone since I was a middle school student, and I was
								fascinated by special animation and practical functions in some applications. At that
								time, I considered whether I can design UI / UX by myself so I began to
								like information technology.

									2. I am a student from China, my name is Jinglin. I am studying at RMIT University
									and I am studying bachelor of IT. My Student ID is s3687531 and my email is
									s3687531@student.rmit.edu.au. My native language is mandarin, I like to play league of legends or jog in my spare time, although I don't have pets, I like dogs very much. I should have started to be interested in IT two years ago because I think hackers are very cool. And the salary of a programmer friend is very good, and the employment prospects are very good. I am not good at face-to-face communication because of personality and language, so the job of the programmer is very suitable for me.

									3. My name is Qiheng Chen and my student number is s3714084. If anyone wants to
									contact me via email then you can sent to s3714084@student.rmit.edu.au. I am
									Chinese and our country have 5 thousand years culture. We also proud of that
									Mandarin have the most users in the world not only in China but in Malaysia,
									Indonesia and so on. I like to play “League of Legends” when I am free. I am
									interested in IT because it is a technique which other people do not have. The first
									time IT engage me is in year 5, my primary school conducted a Q-Basic course.
									However, the only reason we selected that course is that we can play Counter-Strike
									on class. But now I have graduated from RMIT diploma of IT my objective is Java
									and python. RMIT attract me because RMIT's facilities are among the most advanced in Australia. There must be a lot of artificial intelligence in the future, learning python can make me build and understand it.

									4. My name is Zixun Zhou(you can call me Edward) and my student number is
									s3692845. My email address is s3692845@student.rmit.edu.au. I have completed the Diploma of IT and my languages spoken are Mandarin and English. I am from anhui, China. I am currently taking classes in the RMIT university. Chinese is my native language and English is my second language.Currently I live in the city of Melbourne with my family and a cat.I have been in Melbourne for a year, just graduated from the Diploma of IT. My hobbies are playing computer games, such as LOL and CSGO. In fact, I studied IT because I loved playing computer games since I was a child. Usually like to go swimming, because it can help me grow tall. When I was very young, I loved playing computer games. So when I was a child, I decided to work on computers after I grew up. So when I chose a major in college, I chose IT. IT made me feel interested. On the one hand, IT can let me do a lot of things that can't be done in reality, and close the distance between people. At the same time, for me, it is also an unknown world, a world I want to explore.

									5. My name is Wenjie Chen. I also have an English name, Monroe. I am an overseas
									student from south China so Chinese is my first language. My country has a long
									history and many special foods. My email address is s3637291@student.rmit.edu.au. Before entering the university, I only completed my high school study in China. People in my hometown like spicy food as much as I do. Besides, I usually enjoy traveling, singing and playing all kinds of online games in daily life. I was intrigued when I first came across personal computers in 2007. It was like opening the door to a new world. My father used spreadsheets early on to keep track of company bills. I thought it would replace paper and pens and it could be easier to save or modify. My previous courses did not include any information technology related knowledge so I did not have any experience in this field. At the same time, I hope I could gain some new skills in university.
