									<p>Our groupâ€™s project idea is to make a new VR game, a VR version of the Monster Hunter: The World. It allows the player to enter a virtual game world, providing the player with a simulation of the senses of sight, hearing, touch, etc., allowing the player to experience the immersive experience while being free to interact with the things in the space, providing a brand new The game world allows players to experience the world of the game more deeply and intuitively, realize various fantasy that cannot be realized in real life, and let the game develop to a new ladder.
</p>
									<p>From the earliest text MUD games to 2D games to 3D games, with the development of technology, players become more and more impressed with the game, and the realism needed is getting stronger and stronger. The existing games are already fast. Can not meet the needs of players, the emergence of virtual reality technology, will promote the development of the game, it not only makes the game more realistic, but also allows players to immerse in it, which will make players more interesting to experience the game. From the data point of view, the number of players in the world exceeds 2.3 billion in 2018, and the revenue exceeds 137.9 billion US dollars. This is a very huge market, and the new VR game will attract a large number of game lovers and will give them a better experience.
</p>
									<p>This is a VR game similar to the monster hunter world. Players can enter a new world(a monster world). The main goal of the player is to hunt down evil monsters. Players don't need to use the mouse and keyboard to operate the game. Instead, they use virtual reality technology to bring players into this virtual world. It will bring the player a true vision and hearing. Feelings such as touch, and being able to interact freely with things in the space. In this world, unlike the real world, you can do things that you can't do in real life without violating the rules of the game, such as flying. , kill monsters, and PK with other players. In this game, you will be playing with players from all over the world, which means you will encounter players from all over the world and draw closer to the players around the world. At the same time, you will also see many scenes that you can't see in real life in the game. You can even put all the famous scenery in the world into this game, so that players can travel to the world in the game. We also offer an online trading system where players can freely exchange the items they need to sell. We do not sell game props in the game, affecting the game balance. Players only need VR devices and computers, and after purchasing our games, they can enjoy everything in this game. We also update the game regularly and hold various events to ensure that the game will run for a long time. When the game develops To a certain extent, we will also host esports competitions to ensure that at least three global events are held each year, allowing players to enjoy the fun of competition and receive corresponding bonuses. This is a real-name game. For players under the age of 16, we will develop anti-addiction systems to help them better control their game time. We will develop and sell new VR devices. And sell our games on a platform like Steam. And according to the game, make movies, anime. This will be the source of our product revenue.
</p>
									<p>The development of this VR game requires a very high level of technical requirements, and the current physical discomfort that the player may experience during the experience, such as dizziness. Because in the virtual reality game, the player usually moves in the first person perspective, it is likely to have a different degree of vertigo reaction, which is related to the human body adaptability and computer configuration, but the main reason is the motion tracking of the virtual reality device itself. problem. When the person is moving the head, the device needs to detect the movement of the head in time and respond to the adjustment of the display angle to give a real sense of presence. Most of the current devices use the motion tracking sensor to achieve this function, but in the process of using, sometimes the picture can not keep up with the head movement, which will bring obvious dizziness and discomfort to the player, so not only the game is required. Open, you need to develop a new VR device and a computer device that can run the game perfectly. And you need to create a super high-quality video screen, giving players a deeper sense of substitution.
</p>
									<p>Developers need at least C# Foundation, Unity Foundation, Unity Project Combat, VR Common Design Patterns, Data Structure, 3D Data Math, Graphics, File Storage, Multithreading, SVN Usage, Socket, AssetBundle, Game Framework, Lua, Python Knowledge And this is a huge project that requires a lot of manpower and material resources to achieve.Developers also need a good working environment and highly configured equipment to help developers develop projects more efficiently. Professional VR devices are also needed to help developers test the program.
</p>
									<p>If the project is successful, it will bring the game industry into a new field, which will completely subvert the original game mode. Once this technology matures, the game industry will be completely changed. The video game that was originally in two-dimensional space will be completely abandoned. The game mode that relies solely on the keyboard or the handle operation will become history forever. Instead, it can mobilize all the five senses. The orientation game experience, by then, 3D games will also become mainstream, giving players a real experience that seems to be in a different dimension space. Perfectly solves the problem of modern game substitution and lack of realism. And it will have a huge impact on all walks of life. Bring technology to a whole new world. (For example, in the tourism industry, players can experience the scenery of various countries in the game and have an impact on the tourism industry.)
