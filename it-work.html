									<p>I was talking to a Software engineer</p>
									<p>Software engineers usually define problems through analysis and develop solutions based on the project requirements to determine the feasibility of the project.
Develop documentation, flowcharts, layouts, flowcharts, diagrams, code notes, and clear code to develop and demonstrate solutions;
</p>
									<p>Participate in software engineering system design, development, testing and other processes; Prepare and install solutions by defining and designing system specifications, standards, and programming. Perform system analysis to improve operations and recommend changes to policies and procedures. Study system flow, data usage and workflow; Investigation of problem areas; Follow the software development lifecycle. Coordinate the work of individual programmers and work with other software engineers. Responsible for the code implementation of the main functions in the project.</p>
									<p>Projects that need to be completed by software engineers are usually team collaboration projects. Therefore, it is necessary to communicate with team members frequently to ensure that problems can be identified and solutions developed in a timely manner, and the quality and progress of the project can be effectively controlled. When working on a project, you should first know the requirements, so you should have a good communication with the project manager or customers, which can reduce the rework times and make clear the task arrangement.
</p>
									<p>Projects that require software engineers to complete are usually teamwork projects. Therefore, it is necessary to communicate frequently with team members to ensure timely detection of problems and solutions to effectively control the quality and progress of the project. When you're working on a project, you should know the requirements first, so you should have good communication with the project manager or customer, which can reduce the number of rework and determine what each member needs to accomplish.
</p>
									<p>IT professionals spend most of their day completing tasks and finding information. Because the needs of each project are different, there will be situations where the IT staff receiving the project does not meet certain requirements of the project, so IT professionals need to spend some time self-study to meet the project requirements.
</p>
									<p>The IT industry is an industry that is constantly changing and innovating. In the face of emerging new technologies, software engineers need to master the latest IT practical technologies in the shortest time. This is undoubtedly the biggest challenge for software engineers. This requires IT staff to have strong learning ability, understanding ability, thirst for knowledge and enterprising heart.
