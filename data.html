					<p>Name: Wenjie Chen
						<br>Ideal job: Software Engineer
						<br>Looking at the data, my view of my dream job has not changed. Most of the requirements for skills and experience are focused on three to five years. I think this requirement is reasonable and not severe. In addition, my job title is the largest in the recruitment demand, so the demand for this job should be great. This fact proves that the job is very welcome and it may reduce the competitiveness of the industry
