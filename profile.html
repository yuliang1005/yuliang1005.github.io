									<p>1. My name is Yuliang Lei and my student name is s3704446. My email address is s3704446@student.rmit.edu.au. China is my hometown and I could speak Mandarin and Chinese. I have finished Diploma of IT. My hobbies are playing guitar and gaming. I love using mobile phone since I was a middle school student, and I was fascinated by special animation and practical functions in some applications. At that time, I considered whether I can design a mobile application by myself, and I began to like information technology.</p>

True altruists and perfectionist.

									<p>Creativity test: Good at persistence, which can change ones perspective on a situation. Lack of Paradox and Complexity, which means there is a shortage in Conflict resolution ability and information management ability. These results give me a detailed introduction of my character, learning style and creativity. Not only that, they also indicate my present situation, and give me a guidance what aspect I should make efforts in the future. It will affect my division of work in the group, and my characteristic will support me to do some attentive but not use too much creativity works, such as arrange this project, and do color code things. When I set up a team, I would invite members with different characteristics in order to let every member has their own strengths, such as an auditory learner can fill my vacancy in this aspect. Besides, team members can learn from each other and make progress, thus form an efficient team.</p>

									<br><br>
									<p>2. I am a student from China, my name is Jinglin. I am studying at RMIT University and I am
studying bachelor of IT. My Student ID is S3687531 and my email is s3687531@student.rmit.edu.au. My native language is mandarin, I like to play league of legends or jog in my spare time, although I don't have pets, I like dogs very much.
I should have started to be interested in IT two years ago because I think hackers are very
cool. And the salary of a programmer friend is very good, and the employment prospects are very good. I am not good at face-to-face communication because of personality and language, so the job of the programmer is very suitable for me.</p>
									<p>ISTJs enjoy an orderly life. They like things to be well-organized and pay a great deal of attention to detail. When things are in disarray, people with this personality type may find themselves unable to rest until they have set everything straight and the work has been completed. Because of this need for order, they tend to do better in learning and work environments that have clearly defined schedules, clear-cut assignments and a strong focus on the task at hand. When learning new things, ISTJs do best when the material is something they view as useful with real-world applications. Concrete, factual information appeals to ISTJs, while theoretical and abstract information has little value unless they can see some type of practical use for it. While they may exert tremendous energy into projects they see has valuable, they will avoid wasting time and energy on things that they view as useless or unpractical. ISTJs are both responsible and realistic. They take a logical approach to achieving goals and completing projects and are able to work at a steady pace toward accomplishing these tasks. They are able to ignore distractions in order to focus on the task at hand and are often described as dependable and trustworthy. ISTJs also place a great deal of emphasis on traditions and laws. They prefer to follow rules and procedures that have previously been established. In some cases, ISTJs can seem rigid and unyielding in their desire to maintain structure. People with this personality type are usually very loyal and devoted to family and friends, but may struggle to understand their own emotions and the feelings of others. They can be quite reserved and sometimes fail to pick up on the emotional signals given by other people. However, once they are close to a person and develop an understanding of that person’s feelings and needs, they will expend a great deal of effort toward supporting those needs.</p>

									<img src="images/jinglin2.png"></div>
									<p>It's important, both in terms of understanding your professional personality and in terms of
being flexible in a changing world. At the same time, it is very difficult for me to know myself. Through the test, I can learn about my character strengths and weaknesses in advance during my studies, so that I can adapt to the working life more easily in the future. Through the personality test, my personality is introverted, sensing, thinking, judgment. While people with ISTJ personality type tend to be reserved, practical and quiet. By analysing the specific evaluation in the article, I am more suitable for completing tasks in a team than leading a team. I am more suitable for working behind the scenes, collaborating with small teams or completing tasks independently. When forming a team, I should be cheerful, good communication and leadership partners to join the team, so as to achieve the purpose of complementary personalities.

									<p>3. My name is Qiheng Chen and my student number is s3714084. If anyone wants to contact me via email then you can sent to s3714084@student.rmit.edu.au. I am Chinese and our country have 5 thousand years culture. We also proud of that Mandarin have the most users in the world not only in China but in Malaysia, Indonesia and so on. I like to play “League of Legends”  when I am free. I am interested in IT because it is a technique which other people do not have. The first time IT engage me is in year 5, my primary school conducted a Q-Basic course. However, the only reason we selected that course is that we can play Counter-Strike on class. But now I have graduated from RMIT diploma of IT my objective is Java and python. RMIT attract me because RMIT's facilities are among the most advanced in Australia. There must be a lot of artificial intelligence in the future, learning python can make me build and understand it.</p>
									<p>The result of the online Myers-Briggs test is: Extravert(16%) Sensing(19%) Feeling(6%) Judging(6%) I have a slight preference of Extraversion over Introversion (16%) I have a slight preference for Sensing over Intuition (19%) I have a slight preference of Feeling over Thinking (6%) I have a slight preference of Judging over Perceiving (6%) The result of the online learning style test is: Tactile/Kinesthetic learners learn best when they can use their sense of touch and can move about. If you are a tactile/kinesthetic learner, the suggestions that follow can help me to succeed in school to the best of my ability. Be physically active while I study. Rather than just sit at my desk, occasionally walk back and forth with my textbook or notes as I read the information out loud. To decrease my fidgeting as me study, listen to music, preferably baroque music. However, discontinue this if I find the music to be distracting. Make extensive use of a computer and the Internet. Actively touching the keyboard will keep my mind active. Take extensive written notes in class. Edit and type them later. Study in short blocks of time with frequent but short breaks. Do something physical as me study such as tapping a pencil or squeezing a stress ball. It also suggest me to use my finger as a guide while reading. Act out things I have to learn whenever possible. If I find it difficult to sit at a desk when studying, trying lying on my stomach or back. When trying to remember information, close my eyes and "write" the information in the air. Picture the information in my mind as I do so. Use concrete objects to help me understand math concepts. When trying to learn the spelling of a difficult word, arrange letter blocks to spell the word. The result of the 16personalities test is : 53% Mind This trait determines how we interact with our environment. 63% Energy This trait shows where we direct our mental energy. 51% Nature This trait determines how we make decisions and cope with emotions. 54% Tactics This trait reflects our approach to work, planning and decision-making. 49% Identity This trait underpins all others, showing how confident we are in our abilities and decisions. Integrating all above online test results, I am an extravert in daily life and my future occupation may involve either a lot of direct interaction with other people or involve responsibility for critical tasks. As the analysis, ESFJs enjoy being in charge. They see problems clearly and delegate easily, work hard and play with zest. ESFJs, as do most SJs, bear strong allegiance to rights of seniority. The result tells me my positioning in the team, if I form a team I will find teammates have complementary styles with me. It is the key to build an almighty team.</p>

									<p>According to the job description, I will be a developer of Python to update production-grade applications. Building comprehensive machine learning libraries is the main work. The other part is scheme data science solution for our clients. This job appealing to me because it can combine working and learning together. In the process of working, it is necessary to be flexibility and communicable. Group working is always be a basic skill need to learn even more so do my job with other Python Engineers and data scientists. The standard of this role is 3 years of experience with Python. If you are proficient in using Django and Flask, it will be given priority.</p>

									<p>4. My name is Zixun Zhou(you can call me Edward) and my student number is s3692845. My email address is s3692845@student.rmit.edu.au.  I have completed the Diploma of IT and my languages spoken are Mandarin and English. I am from anhui, China. I am currently taking classes in the RMIT university. Chinese is my native language and English is my second language.Currently I live in the city of Melbourne with my family and a cat.I have been in Melbourne for a year, just graduated from the Diploma of IT. My hobbies are playing computer games, such as LOL and CSGO. In fact, I studied IT because I loved playing computer games since I was a child. Usually like to go swimming, because it can help me grow tall. When I was very young, I loved playing computer games. So when I was a child, I decided to work on computers after I grew up. So when I chose a major in college, I chose IT. IT made me feel interested. On the one hand, IT can let me do a lot of things that can't be done in reality, and close the distance between people. At the same time, for me, it is also an unknown world, a world I want to explore.</p>

									<p>These test results will allow me to better understand my own personality and learning style, expand my own strengths, improve my own deficiencies, and make people better.

									<p>5. My name is Wenjie Chen. I also have an English name, Monroe. I am an overseas
student from south China so Chinese is my first language. My country has a long
history and many special foods. My email address is s3637291@student.rmit.edu.au. Before entering the university, I only completed my high school study in China. People in my hometown like spicy food as much as I do. Besides, I usually enjoy traveling, singing and playing all kinds of online games in daily life. IT is everywhere in our life. Search engines on computers could help people get information faster. They could also watch any video online. These advanced applications are gradually making their way into smaller phones. Our life is becoming more convenient. In addition, I've seen many games grow in terms of graphics and other experiences. Online communication and mobile payments are also incredible to me. All of these developments and innovations happened in a short period of time. I think the future development of this industry is very broad and it may bring more changes to human life. I was intrigued when I first came across personal computers in 2007. It was like opening the door to a new world. My father used spreadsheets early on to keep track of company bills. I thought it would replace paper and pens and it could be easier to save or modify. My previous courses did not include any information technology related knowledge so I did not have any experience in this field. At the same time, I hope I could gain some new skills in university.
</p>
									<p>The following chart shows your top 3 personality type matches.
INFPs are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and beliefs. Focused on possibilities rather than reality, INFPs see potential for a better future, and pursue truth and meaning with their own individual flair. INTPs are philosophical innovators, fascinated by logical analysis, systems, and design. They are preoccupied with theory, and search for the universal law behind everything they see. ISFPs are gentle caretakers who live in the present moment and enjoy their surroundings with cheerful, low-key enthusiasm. They are flexible and spontaneous, and like to go with the flow to enjoy what life has to offer.
</p>
									<p>You are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned with the personal growth of yourself and others. Individualistic and nonjudgmental, you believe that each person must find their own path. You enjoy spending time exploring your own ideas and values, and are gently encouraging to others to do the same. You are creative and often artistic, and enjoy finding new outlets for self-expression. You are accepting and nonjudgmental in your treatment of others, believing that each person must follow their own path. You are flexible and accommodating, and can often see many points of view. It is important to you to support other people; however, you may react strongly if you feel your own values are being violated. You especially hate being steamrolled by people who insist there is one right way to do things. You want an open, supportive exchange of ideas. You value authenticity and want to be original and individual in everything you do. You are often concerned with a search for meaning and truth within yourself. Following tradition holds little appeal for the you; you prefer to do your own exploration of values and ideas, and decide for yourself what seems right. You are often offbeat and unconventional, and feel no desire to conform. You would rather be true to yourself than try to fit in with the crowd.</p>

									<p>Visual learners learn best when information is presented in a written language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams. If you are a visual learner, the suggestions that follow can help you to succeed in school to the best of your ability.
<br>· Create graphic organizers such as diagrams and concept maps that use visual symbols to represent ideas and information.
<br>· When trying to remember information, close your eyes and visualize the information.
<br>· Include illustrations as you take notes in class.
<br>· Use highlighter pens of contrasting colors to color code different aspects of the information in your textbooks.
<br>· Sit in the front of the class so that you can clearly see the teacher. This will allow you to pick up facial expressions and body language that provide cues that what your teacher is saying is important to write in your notes.
<br>· Study in a place that is free from visual distractions.
<br>· When using flashcards, limit the amount of information on a card so that you can form a mental picture of the information.
<br>· Watch videos about topics you are studying in class.
<br>· When hearing a new word you want to remember, visualize its spelling.
<br>· When reviewing information, rewrite or draw the information from memory.
<br>· When taking notes, replace words with symbols wherever possible.
<br>· Type your written notes from class using different fonts, bold print, and underlining to make the most important concepts and facts visually apparent.
<br>· When solving math problems that involve a sequence of steps, draw a series of boxes, each containing the appropriate piece of information in sequence.
</p>

									<p>Confident (in one's own ability to succeed)</p>
									<p>This trait measures the extent to which you are confident in your ability to accomplish and achieve challenging tasks in the workplace. This trait assists employers to learn about your self-confidence in your ability to manage and outperform in the role. Self-confidence is one of the most important indicators for success in the workplace. Therefore, most employers regard it as one of the most important factors in making a selection decision. Your result implies that you generally believe in your ability to manage and accomplish projects and tasks. This belief, however, is not unlimited. You may sometimes feel lacking in confidence or ineffective in your abilities to accomplish goals in the workplace.</p>
									<p>As an introvert, I have always been accustomed to paying attention to my own opinions and immersing myself in the personal world. This means it's easy for me to ignore outside information or other people's feelings. I also like to explore the big picture rather than the details of everything. In fact, the big picture could help people see the root of things, but the details of the components are just as important. Sometimes I prioritize the needs of others because I want to foster relationships by understanding them. Besides, I don't naturally like to be bound by the rules, but our lives are full of them. I like the casual lifestyle because it could bring relaxation to people. In terms of learning, I prefer some real and visual information because it is more intuitive and easy to attract my attention. I personally understand that team work should consist of discussing and helping each other. On the contrary, my personality encourages me to be relatively passive. Even though I have many thoughts in my mind, I don't give priority to them. This makes it difficult for me to fit in because I always wait for others to speak first. On the other hand, I naturally think that I am not as capable as others, but I believe that I could finish some basic work smoothly. This caused me to always wait for instructions on some basic tasks rather than challenge some innovation alone. Due to my lack of confidence, I will lose many opportunities and attempts, so I cannot highlight my due value in the team.</p>
									<div style="text-align:center">
										<img src="images/wenjie1.png"></div>
									<p>The job description mentions that the products in this industry are related to the objects that people touch and use every day. This proves that it has a powerful impact while serving everyone. I think its development and innovation can improve and help the quality of life. Otherwise, the work provides opportunities to collaborate with workers from around the world. I am deeply attracted by such teams and diverse working styles, and this environment could enhance my communication skills and encourage everyone to learn from each other. </p>
									<p>This career requires a software engineering, computer science, mechanical and electrical integration or related professional bachelor or above degree, software design and analysis of the experience, familiar with and use the Java, Python, c + +, c # programming language, some analysis and solving ability for problems, skilled use of engineering mathematics including algebra, calculus, and numerical analysis, kinematics and simplified algorithm, used to have work experience in a multithreaded environment, understand the basic framework of the Scrum or similar knowledge, familiar with the use of various tools, familiar with 3D graphics framework such as OpenGL and DirectX, Proficient in web design.</p>
									<p>Compare and contrast the ideal jobs</p>
									<p>The members of our group have their own ideal jobs through their understanding and learning of information technology during this period. What is surprising is that these occupations have something in common. Through analysis and comparison, we found that most of the members chose to work with developers .Even though they come from different fields such as mobile phone software and some computer languages, they are all within the scope of information technology majors. Moreover, the requirements of every different occupation have some similarities. They all show the importance of teamwork and the need for good writing and communication skills. This reminds us that international students need to strengthen the practice and use of English because it is the basic requirement of these jobs. In addition, only a few of these mentioned bachelor's degree or above. Other job requirements generally include computer language, security management, web design and database related use and knowledge. The difference is that one of our team members chose software engineer as his ideal career. Its general direction is similar to the work related to developers, but it requires more skills, including some analysis and solving ability for problems, skilled use of engineering mathematics, Familiar with the use of various tools, familiar with 3D graphics framework to as OpenGL and DirectX, Proficient in web design. On the other hand is about formulating plans to meet these requirements. This includes some of the same plans as the group members. We all want to finish our current degree first because some of these courses could provide us with job-related basics. Besides, we all think it is necessary to improve our English. To achieve this, it is a good way to communicate with teachers and classmates. Some team members also suggested using their spare time to engage in simple service work to enhance their writing and presentation skills. In contrast, our group members mentioned some unique learning methods, such as borrowing books in the library, searching for knowledge points on the Internet and learning online courses. Because our present ability is limited, we are not qualified for some advanced work in the short term. In summary, the members of our group are all freshmen in the information technology undergraduate program. We could effectively improve our ability to get close to our ideal career within a limited time of university.</p>
