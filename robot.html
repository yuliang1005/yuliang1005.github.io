						<p>The robotics industry is developing very rapidly. As the name implies, robots are machines that mimic human action. It can do a lot of work that is too dangerous and too monotonous for people, and can do the work efficiently. For example, in 1991, Australia used a shearing robot, which is almost twice as fast as artificial sheep shearing. The robot frees humans from the heavy and boring work.
</p>
<p>Robots can do some repetitive or dangerous work, humans do not want to do the work, but also can do some work that humans can't do because of size restrictions, even in an environment like outer space or deep sea, which is not suitable for human existence. Contemporary robots are mainly divided into: industrial robots, welding robots, painting robots, combat robots, scientific research robots, human body robots (semi-robots), pets, doll robots, etc.
</p>
<p>A new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is reshaping the global innovation map and economic structure. The new generation of information technology represented by artificial intelligence accelerates breakthroughs. The research, development and application of robots on a global scale develop rapidly, and each production and life Deep penetration of the field. Robots are rapidly expanding from traditional applications such as handling and assembly to more intelligent and refined advanced manufacturing, medical health, and life services. In the next three years, human-machine collaboration promotes the popularity of robots, and robots are beginning to merge. Human-machine collaboration is an inevitable choice for robot evolution. It is characterized by safety, ease of use, and low cost. Ordinary workers can operate it like an appliance. Secondly, machine vision and deep learning make robots more intelligent. With the development of industrial big data and deep learning, the future will make machine vision become the dominant of intelligent production system, making decisions and pre-judging.</p>
	<p>The development of sensors and general software platforms has played an important role in the development of robots. The general software platform will lower the threshold of the robot industry and promote the popularity of robots. Operating systems, middleware, and programming languages ​​used by different robot manufacturers are different, increasing the cost of use and the scope of robot applications. A common software platform (operating system) will solve this problem, making it easier to use robots like using a smartphone. At present, there are more than 40 kinds of robots supporting ROS, including FANUC, ABB, Yaskawa, ADEPT and other large enterprises. In the future, there is great potential to become a general-purpose, standard robot control system. Second, an important trend in the robotics industry is to install more sensors into the device, such as installing vision, laser sensing, force sensing, torque and other types of sensors to perform more complex tasks, saving time and ensuring humanity. The purpose of security. Robots perform their tasks autonomously in an unattended environment, which is an important part of the detection and decision-making of the surrounding environment. Various sensor products are involved here. Thanks to the various sensors installed inside and outside the robot, these combinations of perceptions make the robot more valuable in the manufacturing process. Especially for collaborative robots, these machines require multiple sensors to work with humans. Robots and humans are a big scene. Collaboration robots are easy to use and have high security, and can work with humans. As an auxiliary tool for the robot, the sensor improves flexibility and feedback to the working environment. It is mainly used for guiding and positioning, detecting and recognizing. The robot wants to be smarter and lacks the sensor.

<p>Robot technology has a huge potential impact on the global labor market. Many people think that with the development of artificial intelligence robots, people have a great impact on employment. In terms of machinery, there are mechanical arms that can weld and assemble better than humans. Still 24 hours of tireless work, in terms of transportation, the driverless car developed by people can follow the prescribed route, do not worry about car accidents caused by fatigue driving, etc., the emergence of artificial intelligence robots will make a lot Unemployed. However, some people think that the large number of deployments and applications of robot systems reduce the number of low-tech jobs, but at the same time create new jobs with high technology content and high returns. For example, people need to be responsible for robot system maintenance. And system programming, these new positions not only fully reflect the value of people, but also can provide people with higher returns on wages. The survey found that if a position is fully automated, the position will eventually disappear. But if the process is only partial, then employment will actually increase because efficiency increases and may affect demand. Between 1995 and 2005, the IT revolution led to a 0.6% increase in labor productivity in Europe, the United States, and Japan, and an overall increase of 1%. This shows that if productivity increases enough to drive demand, the result may be increased employment. Therefore, I believe that the development of the robot industry will have an impact on the work of low-skilled workers, which may make them unemployed because their work is simple and easily replaced by fully automated robots. But at the same time, there will be many high-tech jobs. For example, responsible for robot system maintenance and programming, robot maintenance, etc. There may be problems with polarization.
</p>
<p>The development of robots has a huge impact on our daily lives, which will make our lives more convenient and improve the quality of our lives. In medical terms, robots can assist physicians in diagnosing bacterial infections and selecting appropriate antibiotics for patients. It recognizes 51 pathogens, correctly uses 23 antibiotics, and learns new rules from doctors, modifies existing rules, and explains their diagnosis to users. In the past, when many people had gastrointestinal problems, going to the hospital needed to do colonoscopy or gastroscopy. People who have done it know that it is very painful, but with the development of robots, now only need to swallow micro-robots with cameras, and then by professionals. Control, you can easily check the stomach. The emergence of smart home appliances has improved people's quality of life. When the owner goes out, he can order various systems to work automatically, such as turning off the air conditioner, audio and TV power, and answering the phone automatically. When the owner returns home, he can issue instructions, turn on the air conditioner, adjust the indoor light, turn on the automatic cooking system to cook, brew coffee, etc. Some smart home appliances also have a voice function. When you are alone at home, you can also accompany You chat. In my family, the most common is the sweeping robot and robot butler. The sweeping robot can help you sweep the ground and ease the work of daily life. The robot butler, although called a robot butler, is actually a music player that can chat with you. When you are free, you can chat with you and help you access various materials. Modern robots, because of the popularity problem, have not entered a large number of people's lives, but I believe that with the development and popularity of robots, robots will greatly improve people's living standards.
</p>
<p>The emergence of robots is the development of human intelligence, bringing humanity into a new era of automation.</p>
